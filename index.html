                    <p>
                    Anyone can create an account on OpenStreetMap and start
                    editing immediately.
                    </p>
                    <p>This means that some people with bad
                    intentions make malicious edits, creating places that
                    don't exist, deleting places that do, or adding incorrect
                    information.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class='col5 margin1'>
                    <p>
                    To combat vandalism, OpenStreetMap superusers track
                    recent changes constantly and flag changes that look wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    They can then revert - or undo - incorrect changes and notify
                    the user. Users that repeatedly vandalize the map
                    can have their editing rights suspended or removed entirely.

                <h3>Missing Details</h3>
                <div class='col5'>
                    <p>
                    Since there's no perfect map of the world to compare
                    ours to, finding areas where data is missing is difficult.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Data is often partial - a road is present, but unnamed, or
                    a building lacks basic details that let it be categorized.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class='col5 margin1'>
                    <p>
                    OpenStreetMap has multiple tools to score itself and identify
                    missing data. The <a href='http://qa.poole.ch/'>No Name</a>
                    layer highlights all roads without names and buildings
                    without addresses. <a href='http://www.mapbox.com/foursquare-checkins/'>A worldwide concordance</a>
                    of Foursquare checkins versus OpenStreetMap data shows
                    areas where people are and data isn't.

                <h3>Routing Problems</h3>
                <div class='col5'>
                    <p>
                    One of the most important uses of OpenStreetMap is for
                    routing: tools like <a href='http://map.project-osrm.org/'>OSRM</a>
                    and <a href='http://open.mapquest.com/'>MapQuest Open</a> provide
                    driving directions based on of its data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Problems with this routing network are invisible to other
                    users of the map, and can include disconnected roads,
                    improper turn restrictions, and unmarked speed limits.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class='col5 margin1'>
                    <p>
                    A number of tools automatically comb through OSM data to
                    find potential routing issues. <a href='http://maproulette.org/'>MapRoulette</a>
                    finds highways without lane counts or speed limits, while
                    <a href='http://keepright.at/report_map.php?zoom=12&lat=39.95356&lon=-75.12364'>Keep Right</a>
                    identifies many more routing issues, like unreachable roads
                    oneway roads that dead-end.
